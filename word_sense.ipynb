    "## How the experiment works\n",
    "We used python3 as our programming language to implement the paper. We also used ***nltk*** package which is a widely used python package to work with natural language. We used ***WordNet*** which is a lexical database for the English language.\n",
    "We used four different types of word embedding models, which are:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. [Glove](http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip)\n",
    " 2. [Dependency-Based](http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~yogo/data/syntemb/deps.words.bz2)\n",
    " 3. [Bag of Words (k = 2)](http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~yogo/data/syntemb/bow2.words.bz2)\n",
    " 4. [Bag of Words (k = 5)](http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~yogo/data/syntemb/bow5.words.bz2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, before we start to describe how our experiment works we need to describe some terms of our implementation. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Synset\n",
    "> \"Synonyms are words that have similar meanings. A synonym set, or **synset**, is a group of synonyms. A synset, therefore, corresponds to an abstract concept.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Synset definition\n",
    "> \"Any word in the wordnet has some definitions associated with the word. A word can have multiple definitions which means every word can have multiple synsets and every synset has its own definition\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Word tokenizer\n",
    "> A word tokenizer splits word from the definition sentence of a synset and keeps those words in an array\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pos tagger\n",
    "> pos-tagger/parts of speech tagger tags every word with respective parts of speech. For example, Noun, Verb, Adjective, etc\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pos tagger\n",
    "> pos-tagger/parts of speech tagger tags every word with respective parts of speech. For example, Noun, Verb, Adjective, etc\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cosine similarity\n",
    " >Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors (in our case it is a word) of an inner product space that measures the cosine of the angle between them.\n",
    "#### WSD- word sense disambiguation\n",
    "> **word-sense disambiguation** (**WSD**)  concerned with identifying which sense of a word is used in a sentence.\n",
    "#### Lemma\n",
    "> The term ***Synset*** stands for \"set of synonyms\". A set of synonyms is a set of words with similar meaning, e.g. _ship, skiff, canoe, kayak_ might all be synonyms for _boat_. In the nltk, a ***Synset*** is, in fact, a set of ***lemmas*** with related meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description of the algorithm\n",
    "#### The steps can be described as followings:\n",
    " 1. The code first reads the word embedding from the file and stores it as a dictionary. The key of the dictionary is word and value is numpy array\n",
    " 2. From the input dataset, we read every line from the text file and we run our code for each of the lines. \n",
    " 3. For each line, we get a list of words with their respective parts of speech (**POS**). Now for every allowed **POS**(Noun, Verb, Adjective, Adverb) we find the associated vector/numpy array from our word embedding and store it in a dictionary. We also make a separate list for these chosen words only. \n",
    " 4. Now from this dictionary, we get word as key and values are vectors. We call this word as ***candidate word*** and vector as ***candidate vector***. For every candidate word, we find a list of ***Lemma/Sense***.   For every ***Lemma/Sense*** we find it's **key** and ***definition/glossary*** sentences.\n",
    " 5.  Now the ***definition/glossary*** of each sense are sentences. We repeat the steps to get words and it's respective parts of speech using ***pos-tagger*** again.  (We take only the Noun, Verb, Adjective, Adverb as per the paper). For every word we again get the word vector from the word embedding dictionary we calculate ***cosine similarity*** with ***candidate vector***. If the cosine similarity is bigger than a threshold we store the vector/array in a list. Lastly, we calculate the average of the vector for every Sense of the word and store the value in a dictionary. So, here the key is the Sense and value is the average of the vector/array. \n",
    " 6. Now for every Sense for every word for the original sentence we get a dictionary where the key is the Sense and value is the vector/numpy array. We calculate the number of Sense against the word and sort it by the length of Sense. \n",
    " 7. In the next step, we store this Sense and it's vector/numpy array against its actual word in a dictionary. \n",
    " 8. Now we find the length of the Sense and store in against its actual word in a different dictionary and we sort it by its length. \n",
    " 9. We initialize a context vector by the average of each word's vector. For every word in the context vector, we calculate the cosine similarity with the candidate word. We take the word which has the highest cosine similarity. We call the process as ***WSD- word sense disambiguation***. \n",
    " 10. If we can disambiguate any word we find the sense key and its name.\n",
    " 11. Now from the experiment dataset we read the text files and separate the key. With this key, we find it's corresponding sense key from the gold standard dataset. If we find it we call it as a recall. If we can not find it then it's a failure. \n",
    "> #### According to the paper, four persons had put the sentence key and several sense keys in the gold standard dataset. We counted the most common sense keys and selected one single sense key. \n",
    "  \n",
    "## Example for success\n",
